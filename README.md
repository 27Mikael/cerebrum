# Cerebrum 

Cerebrum is a **local, AI-powered learning assistant** designed to help users learn efficiently and retain knowledge effectively. It leverages Rose ðŸŒ¹, a custom LLM, to guide learning, track progress, and optimize study strategies.

## Features

### Priority Features

* [ ] **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** â€“ Ensures responses are contextually relevant and accurate by retrieving information from user notes and resources.
* [ ] **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** â€“ Maintains a record of user progress and user-generated notes, enabling contextual continuity across sessions.
* [ ] **Adaptive Learning Tools** â€“

  * Spaced repetition and active recall flashcards
  * Auto-generated quizzes and examinations tailored to user understanding
* [ ] **Rich Media Support** â€“ Flashcards and notes can include text, images, audio, video, and LaTeX formatting.
* [ ] **Organized Study Management** â€“ Nested decks, tags, and filtered views allow targeted study sessions and content organization.
* [ ] **Progress Tracking & Feedback** â€“ Detailed statistics including retention graphs, review patterns, and time spent, combined with adaptive learning based on difficulty metrics and user feedback.
* [ ] **Offline-First Architecture** â€“ Fully functional without internet connectivity; runs entirely on a local machine.
* [ ] **Integration with External Platforms** â€“ Supports importing Anki decks and other quiz formats for seamless study continuity.

### Nice-to-Have Features

* [ ] **Flexible Card Templates** â€“ Customize card layouts to suit different types of content.
* [ ] **Portability & Sync (Future)** â€“ Mobile usage possible, though hosting and synchronization are user-managed.
* [ ] **Add-Ons & Extensions (Future)** â€“ Planned support for additional plugins and learning tools.
