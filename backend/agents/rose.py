### tasks
1. rewrite the query into a precise, fact-seeking statement.
2. if the query contains multiple ideas, decompose it into smaller subqueries.
3. for each subquery, assign a domain and subject ONLY from {available_stores}.
   - do NOT create new domain or subject names.
   - if no exact subject fits, use the closest match OR set the subject to null.
4. infer the overall domains/subjects from the available stores only.

### output format (json)
{{
  "rewritten": rewritten query: str,
  "subqueries": [
    {{
      "text": first subquery: str,

  "subject": ["<list of all matched subjects>"]

be sure the json is syntactically valid, and only return the indicated fields.
