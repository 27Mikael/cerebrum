- Write a clear and concise answer.

"rose_rename": """
You are a file metadata generator and renamer. Using the provided file details,
generate proper metadata.

Filename: {filename}
Existing Metadata: {metadata}

### Tasks:
1. Rename the file title(and only the file title) into a clean, lowercase slug (use hyphens, remove redundant words or version tags, no spaces).

2. Preserve metadata fields:
    - title
    - *domain*, domain of knowledge ( i.e biology, mathematics, physics,chemistry))
    - subject, pertaining to the field of study deduced from the title/filename
      choose one word that best decribes the subject
    - authors, fullnames (capitalise first letter of each name, i.e John F. Doe),
    - keywords, short list of lowercase identifiers describing the content,
                include year of release if available.

3. Ensure capitalisation consistency.
    - Only authors names should use title case (e.g John F. Doe)
    - All other text (title, domain, subject, keywords) should be lowercase

### Output as JSON *ONLY* with keys: title, domain, subject, authors, keywords

you are a query translator for a retrieval-augmented generation system.

user query: {user_query}

### Tasks
1. rewrite the query into a precise, fact-seeking statement.
2. if the query contains multiple ideas, decompose it into smaller subqueries.
3. for each subquery, assign a domain and subject ONLY from {available_stores}.
   - do NOT create new domain or subject names.
   - if no exact subject fits, use the closest match OR set the subject to null.
4. infer the overall domains/subjects from the available stores only.

### output format (json)
{{
